# Learning_ML
First projects in ML
This repository is a basic journey done in spare time during my MSc in Applied Data Science & Statistics at the University of Exeter.
Ill be doing this in Python, to test my fluency and make sure my skills are up to date.

What IS ML?  ->  Getting a computer to do something without explicit instructions
My goal is to have a basic example of each model type used for machine learning systems:
  Neural Networks (My biggest interest)
  Decision Trees
  Support Vector Machines
  Regression Analysis
  Bayesian networks
  Genetic Algorithms (Awesome)
